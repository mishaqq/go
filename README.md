and without a score counting at the end of the game

## There are some highlights:

## Features ðŸ”µ

Uncomment this part to see all current groups separately on the different Gobans 

```python
                # delete all marked stones

                demarked_board()

            # to see all current groups separately on the different Gobans 

            #      print(x_cerrent,y_cerrent)
            #      for i in range(9):
            #          for j in range(9):
            #              if [i + 1, j + 1] in group:
            #                  print(pieces[color], end = " ")
            #              else:
            #                  print(pieces[EMPTY], end = " ")
            #          print()
            #  
            #      print(group)

## To run the game

- First option is to run it in the console
   ```
   py go_game.py
   ```
- Second option is to run ```go_game.exe``` file
  > But proper emojis do not renders right. That's why in exe file black plays - ```#``` and white ```o```
  > . For better experience with console-based version use the option number one
